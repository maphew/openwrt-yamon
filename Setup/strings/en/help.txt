LAUNCHING THE SCRIPT:
Assuming that you've installed the software in the default directory, 
the simplest way to launch the script is to simply type:
  root: /opt/YAMon2/Setup/yamon2.sh

[When no parameter is passed to the script, it assumes that `config.file` 
is found in the default base directory - e.g., `/opt/YAMon2/Setup/`.]

If you have installed the software elsewhere, you should pass the full path
to `config.file` to `yamon2.sh` - as follows:
  root: <path_to_yamon2.sh> <path_to_config_file>

STOPPING THE SCRIPT
To stop the script, you can now enter
  root: /opt/YAMon2/Setup/yamon2.sh --stop
Alternatively, enter `rmdir /tmp/YAMon-running` or delete that 
directory (using WinSCP or equivalent)

GETTING HELP
It seems a little odd that I'd have to explain how to get to the help screens
when you're already here?!?... but to see this help screen, enter 
  root: /opt/YAMon2/Setup/yamon2.sh --help
Alternatively, see http://usage-monitoring.com for more documentation 
and/or ways to contact me.
